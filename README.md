# Advent of Code 2022
## Preface
This year, despite drowning in university work, I also decided to do some Advent of Code challenges.
Doing it in language I have a decent idea of would be rather boring though, therefore I decided to let a friend of mine decide for every single day what language I shall do the challenge in, leading to lots of suffering but also new insights and a lot of educational value.

The downside is of course, that a lot of my solved challenges will make those with more knowledge in the language of a given day puke, but that's worth it.
